Transport charge calculation logic For 30km charge will be 1500rs and after that for each km 50rs (Example : User selected Baghajatin, Kolkata, WB distance is 10km that means for upward and downward it will be 20km so the charge will be 1500rs . But if user selected Garia, Kolkata, WB distance for one way is 20km that means upward and downward will be 40km  which is more that 30km in this case price will be for first 30km 1500rs for next 10km it will be 10 * 50 = 500rs so total 2000rs)
